# Unblock Youku

This project contains three-fold functionalities.

1. _A Google Chrome extension_ helping users access their web services while travelling outside mainland China.
 
   You can find this extension on Chrome Web Store at [http://uku.im/chrome](http://uku.im/chrome)

2. _A local proxy server_ based on the non-blocking [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) for bypassing the mainland restriction _for other browsers and mobile devices_ (but not guaranteed).

   For more information, please see [the instructions](http://uku.im/proxy) (in Chinese).

3. _A backend server_ to support the redirection mode of the Chrome extension.
