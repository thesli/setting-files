  <h1>What's New for DCCT (Double Click Closes Tab)</h1>
  <table class="e1">
    <thead><tr><td style="width:80px;">Version</td><td>New features</td></tr></thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
        <td>1.0.9</td>
        <td>
          <ul>
            <li>Fixed occasional unexpected closing of tab when right clicking just once (IF user chose the 'double right click' to close tab option).</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
        <td>1.0.8</td>
        <td><b>Highly requested feature put in!</b><br />
          <ul>
            <li><b>Double right click</b> to close tab is now an option! - I had a change of heart since yesterday and checked & found that Chrome FINALLY did fix the issue I observed before the prevented using double right click to close tab - so I put the feature in in this version. Please enjoy! BTW I explain what that issue was - a silly oversight by Chrome developers before that they now seemed to have fixed it exactly the same way as I said it could be fixed (shift one pixel like Firefox).</li>
          </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
        <td>1.0.7</td>
        <td>Important maintenance release<br />
          <ul>
            <li>Chrome starts to enforce many code changes to move to manifest v2 - v1 addons will be delisted later. So I put those changes in.</li>
            <li>No change in main features - sorry but I really don't have time to investigate if Chrome's limited API now supports double right click or double click on tabs - to those people who kept asking the same questions: I didn't put these features in because Chrome didn't support it before. I doubt that it supports it now. I personally use Firefox to browse, not Chrome. I have 5 Firefox addons to take care of, most of them more powerful than this one and two much more elaborate ones. That's why I couldn't do much else in my spare time.</li>

            <li>BrowserAction icon to indicate if DCCT works on current page or not (clicking on the icon will close the tab!). This actually applies to all mouse/keyboard-interacting Chrome extensions!</li>
