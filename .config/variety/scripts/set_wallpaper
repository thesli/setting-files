#!/bin/bash
#
# This script is run by Variety when a new wallpaper is set.
# You can use bash, python or whatever suits you for the script.
# Here you can put custom commands for setting the wallpaper on your specific desktop environment
# or run commands like notify-send to notify you of the change, or you can
# run commands that would theme your browser, login screen or whatever you desire.
#
# The first passed parameter (accessed with $1) is the absolute path to the wallpaper image to be set as wallpaper
# (after effects, clock, etc. are applied).
#
# The second passed parameter ($2) is "auto" when the wallpaper is changed automatically (i.e. regular change), "manual"
# when the user has triggered the change or "refresh" when the change is triggered by a change in quotes, clock, etc.
#
# The third passed parameter ($3) is the absolute path to the original wallpaper image (before effects, clock, etc.)
# and "manual" otherwise - e.g. when the user clicks Previous, Next or Trash.


# Here you may apply some additional custom operations on the wallpaper.
# In the end put the path to the actual wallpaper image file in the WP variable
WP=$1
